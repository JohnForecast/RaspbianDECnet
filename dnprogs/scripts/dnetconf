# INFORMATION ON STARTING DNETD FROM /etc/conf.d/local.start
# 
# Here is an example from my own machine that I use to get the
# service started in the bootup process

# bring the interface down
# ifconfig your_default_interface down

# run the dnetd startup script
# /etc/init.d/dnetd start

# bring the interface backup
# ifconfig your_default_interface up

# make sure the default interface is known to the kernel
# echo "your_default_interface" > /proc/sys/net/decnet/default_device

# make sure this hosts node name is known to the kernel
# echo "mynodename" > /proc/sys/net/decnet/node_name

# echo make sure this hosts node address is known to the kernel
# echo mynodeaddress > /proc/sys/net/decnet/node_address

# re-add the default gateway is your gateway is set manually or is static
# route add default gw default_gw

# Add neighbors to the default interface with addresses of remote_node_address(1-3) 
# to the kernel
# ip -f dnet neigh add remote_node_address1 dev default_interface
# ip -f dnet neigh add remote_node_address2 dev default_interface
# ip -f dnet neigh add remote_node_address3 dev default_interface
