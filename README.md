README.Raspbian

  Detailed instructions for downloading and installing DECnet on a Raspberry Pi.
  
  
BuildAndInstall.sh

  Shell script which automates most of the process of installing DECnet on a Raspberry Pi:
  
  1. Create a working directory on the target Pi system and make that the current directory
  
  2. Copy BuildAndInstall.sh to this directory and make it executable
  
  3. Execute the shell script, answer the questions and wait for a new kernel and DECnet utilities to be built
     (It may take a long time depending on the model of Pi)
     
  4. After installing a new kernel and the DECnet utilities, you will need to decide how and when you want DECnet
     to start (see section 6 of README.Raspbian for details).
